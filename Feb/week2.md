1. Mahony et al. :  The halo model with beyond-linear halo bias: unbiasing cosmological constraints from galaxy-galaxy lensing and clustering \
https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.01790.pdf \
A bias challenge related paper: Address the impact of nonlinear in halo model. Section 2 gives a good intro to the theory formalism.
(Compare with the one implemented in the project, see if that one account for 'assembly bias')
