1. Krishnan and Mondol: H0 as a Universal FLRW Diagnostic \
https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.13384.pdf \
H0 tension: the measurement of H0 inferred from observation at different z (z ~ 1000 and z ~ 0) varies.\
This paper advertises the idea of H0 inverse as a diagnostic to verify the vadlidity of any FLRW model because of the tension.

2. Barnes: The Friedman-Lemaˆıtre-Robertson-Walker Metric: a centennial review \
https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.13120.pdf \
Maybe a good source for some basic cosmology + GR (history) review. Also talks about the ongoing problem with FLRW.

3. E/B mode decomposition of HSC-Y1 cosmic shear using COSEBIs: cosmological constraints and comparison with other two-point statistics \
https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.12698.pdf \

https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.00032.pdf \
Disucssion on Gertsenshtein-Zel′dovich effect to explain the large amount energy from Fast Radio Burst (FRB). \
Basic idea: "GWs get converted to EM waves in the prescence of strong transverse magnetic fields." \
Two ingredients: a. compact object with B field ~ 10 Gauss b. GHz freq GW

https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.00958.pdf This is an interesting (kind of weird..) paper that offers some personal view on Dark Matter formalism.
