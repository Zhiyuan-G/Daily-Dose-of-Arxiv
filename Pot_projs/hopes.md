# Potential Projects:
- Using higher-order statistics to better constrain HOD for LSST like galaxies? (Idea born in Apr 1)\
  Motivation paper: Zhang et al.: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.17214.pdf (See Mar week5 Apr 1)

- Measure galaxy bias using counts-in-cells for LSST? (Idea born in Apr 7) \
  Motivation paper: Salvador et al.: https://academic.oup.com/mnras/article/482/2/1435/5134168
  Investigate how different clustering statistics can constrain cosmological parameters. \
