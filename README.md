## Jan 26 2022:
1. G. A. Peña, G. N. Candlish: The large-scale structure from non-Gaussian primordial perturbations
https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.08842.pdf \
Non-Gaussian and inflation, may have some good reference to PT in intro section. \
(Related paper for background -> higher order statistics to probe non-Gaussian  "Primordial non-Gaussianity in the Bispectrum of the Halo Density Field"
: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1011.1513.pdf)

2. Tobias et al.: The black hole population in low-mass galaxies in large-scale cosmological simulations \
https://arxiv.org/pdf/1011.1513.pdf \
This paper talks about sub-grid physics (star formation, stellar and SN feedback, BH formation, evolution and feedback) in cosmological simulations, with a focus on BH phyics.

3. Side paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.09848.pdf. May be a good source to learn something about H_0 tension.

## Jan 30 2022:
1. Ji et al. : Cosmological perturbations: non-cold relics without the Boltzmann hierarchy \
https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.11129.pdf  \
Theoretical paper propose a new method to replace Boltzmann hierarchies calculation method for collisionless species. Fig 1 in the paper has a nice description of the classic (hierachies) and the new method.

2. D'Amico et al. : Limits on primordial non-Gaussianities from BOSS galaxy-clustering data \
https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.11518.pdf

## Jan 31 2022:
1. Saifollahi et al.: Implications for Galaxy Formation Models from Observations of Globular Clusters around Ultra-Diffuse Galaxies \
https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.12308.pdf \
Mainly for the reference of the LSST fringing paper. See brightness unit used for ultra-diffuse galaxy. (UDG is a sub-class of low surface brightness (LSB) galaxy.)

2. Hausen and Robertson:  FitsMap: A Simple, Lightweight Tool For Displaying Interactive Astronomical Image and Catalog Data \ 
https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.12308.pdf \
A new imaging tool (like DS9..). This paper offers a good overview of the current imaging toolist.

https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.00670.pdf \
LPT method for IC with massive neutrinos for N-body simulation.

2. Gaztanaga: The Cosmological Constant as Event Horizon \
https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.00641.pdf \

3. Ashu Kushwaha: Gertsenshtein-Zel′dovich effect explains the origin of Fast Radio Bursts \
https://arxiv.org/pdf/2202.00032.pdf \
Disucssion on Gertsenshtein-Zel′dovich effect to explain the large amount energy from Fast Radio Burst (FRB). \
Basic idea: "GWs get converted to EM waves in the prescence of strong transverse magnetic fields." \
Two ingredients: a. compact object with B field ~ 10 Gauss b. GHz freq GW
