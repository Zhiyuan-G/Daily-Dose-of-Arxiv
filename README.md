1. G. A. PeÃ±a, G. N. Candlish: The large-scale structure from non-Gaussian primordial perturbations
https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.08842.pdf \
Non-Gaussian and inflation, may have some good reference to PT in intro section. \

2. Tobias et al.: The black hole population in low-mass galaxies in large-scale cosmological simulations \
https://arxiv.org/pdf/1011.1513.pdf \
This paper talks about sub-grid physics (star formation, stellar and SN feedback, BH formation, evolution and feedback) in cosmological simulations, with a focus on BH phyics.

3. Side paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.09848.pdf. May be a good source to learn something about H_0 tension.

1. Ji et al. : Cosmological perturbations: non-cold relics without the Boltzmann hierarchy \
https://arxiv.org/pdf/2201.11129.pdf  \
Theoretical paper propose a new method to replace Boltzmann hierarchies calculation method for collisionless species. Fig 1 in the paper has a nice description of the classic (hierachies) and the new method.
