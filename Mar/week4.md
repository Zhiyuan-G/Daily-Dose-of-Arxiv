3. Brando et al: Enabling matter power spectrum emulation in beyond-ΛCDM cosmologies with COLA \
https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.11120.pdf \
"Emulators are numerical interpolations that are trained using accurate N-body simu- lation outputs based on machine learning algorithms to quickly predict the matter power spectrum from linear to non-linear scales in the vast cosmological parameter space."

https://arxiv.org/pdf/2203.11069.pdf \
" To bridge the gap, a galaxy–halo relation that modulates the clustering of haloes to match the observation is of great importance. Because it enables the direct comparison between the theory and the observation via simulation "
